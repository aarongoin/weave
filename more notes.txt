Host app as static site in S3 bucket with caching publicly max-age=604800 (7 days)
app.html
app.css
app.js


That gives openings for weekly deployments. If using max age instead of Expires header, then all users will receive the newest deployment within 1 week as their old cached version ages out. Could use Expires to set explicit deadlines.

Use AWS Lambda for App purchasing, User authentication, and Project Cloud-sync

User Profiles:
User is a writer that writes on their laptop or desktop computer. Even if they own multiple devices, they probably prefer to use a single device for writing. If they were to use the cloud, it would be primarily for backing up their work, or viewing/working on it if they happen to be away from their primary device.



Scenario:
User has device with App installed.
User has device but no App

I'm not interested in cloud features.
I don't want to pay that much.
I just don't care.
